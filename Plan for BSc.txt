Plan for BSc:


Blok 2
Our main project goal is to gauge different means of assessing brain develop-
ment and motor function in infants. This will involve a comprehensive literature
search to identify open data sets, such as the BOBS Repository, to evaluate
existing methods and state-of-the-art techniques of infant brain segmentation,
followed by a comparative analysis of these methods. The results of this initial
analysis will form the basis of developing a prototype framework for segmenting
the first images acquired through the NIBS-CP study.

Blok 3
Furthermore we wish to explore the possibilities of improving the existing meth-
ods for segmentation of baby brains. Achieving this entails the employment of
advanced image analysis methods in an attempt to beat the benchmark perfor-
mance that has been established using existing techniques.
